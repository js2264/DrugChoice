# DrugChoice

This Shiny app was developed fr sudo:sequence Hackathon 2018, in Cambridge. It won the first prize in the "Wildtype" contest!
The app relies on a machine learning approach to compare genomic sequencing datasets of a patient pre- and post-drug treatment to a repository of existing case studies of drug efficacy and relationship with epigenomic changes.
For the purpose of the Hackathon, a dummy database was generated in silico to illustrate the potential of ML-based clustering method of comparison to assess effectiveness of a drug for a given patient.
